    <h1>Thailand!</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p class=bg-primary>Thailand is the travel hub of Southeast Asia. Most people coming into the region fly into Bangkok and make that their base for doing the circuit around Southeast Asia. With its lush jungles, famed beaches, world-class diving, amazing food, and cheap prices, Thailand attracts visitors from all walks of life. It is by far my favorite country in the world! You can find super cheap guesthouses, and then seemingly right next door you can find resorts charging upwards of $10,000 USD a night! With all the variance, finding inexpensive accommodations is definitely doable. Travel through Thailand is easy. The country is a well-worn destination on the backpacking trail and everything is convenient and easy.
    <p class=bg-success>Though well on the map, there are still good destinations to visit away from the crowds and the prices they bring. Overall, Thailand speaks for itself. Itâ€™s so well known around the world that when you hear the name, you already think about beaches, beauty, jungles, and food. And your thoughts are spot on.</p>
